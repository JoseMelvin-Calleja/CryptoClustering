# CryptoClustering

In this project, we use K-Means clustering to classify multiple cryptocurrencies into groups. We, first, scale the numerical data. From there, we run a K-Means cluster analysis with that orginal, scaled data. Then, we ran a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on that data and performed the same K-Means clustering process on the new PCA Data. With this, we compare the clusters between the original, scaled data and the PCA data to find similarities and differences.
